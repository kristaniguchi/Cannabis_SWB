Calculate impaired flows
===

Original code provided by Daron Pedroja (CA State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Water Rights).

The code has been modified to make some corrections (for example, October was missing from the output), and extended to handle multiple datasets (`inputs.yaml`). We also added a process_inputs notebook to clean up input data, and a summarize notebook to help analyze why some of the reports contain negative impaired flows. The conda `environment.yml` has been modified by adding just a package or two.
